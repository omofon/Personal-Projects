# 🎨 Client Brief: FlowStudio – Creative Agency

## 🏢 About the Brand

FlowStudio is a digital creative agency that blends design, storytelling, and technology to craft interactive digital experiences. We help brands flow seamlessly between creativity and functionality, turning bold ideas into beautiful, usable realities.

Think of it as a space where motion, colour, and clarity meet balance.

## 🎯 Goal of the Website

The goal is to create a visually appealing yet functional landing page that:

1. Instantly communicates FlowStudio's creativity and professionalism.
2. Shows off portfolio-style sections (Design, Development, Branding).
3. Encourages potential clients to get in touch via a call-to-action form or dialog.
4. Has smooth interactive effects (cursor changes, hover animations, reveal transitions).
5. Looks beautiful on all devices — from large monitors to mobile screens.

Basically: "We want users to feel the creativity the moment they land, not just read about it."

## 🧭 Focal Point of the Website

The Hero section is the heartbeat, it immediately grabs attention through:

- A creative tagline
- Subtle motion (animated gradients, floating shapes, or smooth transitions)
- Interactive cursor or popover
- A call-to-action button leading to services or contact

From there, the flow should guide visitors: Hero → Services → Team → Contact Dialog.

## 🖼️ Design Style

We want:

- A modern minimalistic design — clean layouts, large readable fonts.
- But with a creative edge — subtle animations, geometric shapes, and accent colors.
- Balanced whitespace and strong visual hierarchy.

So: 🧘‍♂️ Minimal, but alive. 🎨 Creative, but clean.

## 🎨 Color Palette

Here's a proposed modern creative palette that fits the FlowStudio identity:

| Purpose | Color | HEX | Description |
|---------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Primary | Electric Violet | `#6C63FF` | Represents creativity & innovation |
| Accent | Coral Pink | `#FF6584` | Adds warmth and energy |
| Background | Dark Charcoal | `#0F0F11` | Neutral base for contrast |
| Surface | Graphite Gray | `#1C1C20` | For cards and sections |
| Text | Mist White | `#EAEAEA` | Clean and readable on dark base |
| Highlight | Cyan Blue | `#00E0FF` | For hover states and gradients |

### Gradient Examples

- `linear-gradient(135deg, #6C63FF, #FF6584)`
- `linear-gradient(90deg, #6C63FF, #00E0FF)`

## 🖼️ Imagery and Media

- Abstract geometric shapes, floating blobs, or minimal 3D mockups.
- Use masked team images (circle or organic blob shape).
- Subtle background gradients or grain textures to add depth.
- Optional micro animations using CSS transitions (hover, focus, scroll-in).

## 🌀 Animations & Motion

- Smooth cursor follow or highlight effect.
- Fade-in & slide-in transitions on scroll (CSS `@keyframes` + intersection effects if needed).
- Button hover glows, gradient shifts, and `:focus-within` animations.
- Dialog pop-ups with scale or opacity transitions.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The design should adapt beautifully between:

- **Desktop** (≥ 1024px) – spacious layout, big visuals.
- **Tablet** (600–1023px) – stacked columns, preserved animations.
- **Mobile** (≤ 599px) – simplified navigation, still retains visual identity.

Use CSS functions like `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` for typography and spacing fluidity.

## 🧩 Core Sections (Final Website Outline)

| Section | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Hero | First impression | Animated gradient, headline, CTA |
| Services | Showcase expertise | Counters, cards, z-index layers |
| Team | Humanize the brand | Masked portraits, popover bios |
| Contact | Conversion point | Tooltip inputs, dialog form |
| Footer | Wrap up | Minimal, simple brand tag & socials |

## 🧠 Client Summary Statement

"FlowStudio's website should make people feel like they've stepped into a living piece of design — not overcomplicated, but effortlessly beautiful. It should showcase the balance between creativity and precision that defines who we are."
