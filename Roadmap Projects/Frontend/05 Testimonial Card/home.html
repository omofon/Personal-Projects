          I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh and I am
          suprised how far I have come from where I started.
          <br /><br />
          Highly recommended!

        Since starting career in 2021, I have only followed one resource,
        roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 0 to having a job and changing
        the financial trajectory of my family.

          I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior
          developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

        roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
        during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
        repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has
        had on millions of lives since then.
